# fdm_injection_analysis

In this repository, you will find the codes built by Brendan Drachler to produce fake NANOGrav datasets with various signals injected. Most notably, this repository will focus on the injection, recovery, and analysis of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) signals. We use Libstempo to perform the injections.

The repository contains a demo Jupyter notebook that walks the user through creating a fake dataset. It also contains a standalone Python script that does this in a simple manner.
